   ----

   Simplify the way your editors may upload their images: no complex local
   procedure needed, let TYPO3 automatically resize down their huge
   images/pictures on-the-fly during upload (or using a scheduler task for batch
   processing) and according to your own business rules (directory/groups). This
   will highly reduce the footprint on your server and speed-up response time if
   lots of images are rendered (e.g., in a gallery).
   Features an EXIF/IPTC extractor to ensure metadata may be used by the FAL
   indexer even if not preserved upon resizing.
